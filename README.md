# FableForge - Get Coding Module 2 Project

## Introduction

In 2023, I joined the Get Coding mentorship program. This program offers individuals an opportunity to reskill themselves for the dynamic tech industry by equipping them with the essential tools and skills demanded by today's developers. As part of this program, students like me are paired with local mentors who provide guidance through each module.

## Module Two Project

As of March 2024, I have completed my second Get Coding project, FableForge. This application was written inReact.js. By completing this module now I can:

1. Understand the 3-tier architecture, limitations and responsibilities of each tier.
2. Create fairly complex front-ends using React.js without help.
3. Be hired as a junior front-end developer.

## FableForge

FableForge is a toolkit designed for 5th edition Dungeon Masters. With FableForge, users can easily organize sessions, quests, and loot. Elevate your storytelling experience with AI tools for NPC creation, TTRPG maps, and campaign summaries.
The initial idea behind FableForge was to create an application for storing and sorting through session data. FableForge provides tools to log sessions, display them individually, and create a comprehensive campaign summary based on the gathered data. The Quest Tracker allows you to log both main and side quests, while the Loot Manager utilizes an API, enabling users to log their items and access associated descriptions.

Storing API keys directly in a React application without a backend poses security risks, therefore you will need a OpenAI API key to use the AI tools on FableForge.
