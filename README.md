# FableForge - Get Coding Module 2 Project

## Introduction

In 2023, I joined the Get Coding mentorship program. This program offers individuals an opportunity to reskill themselves for the dynamic tech industry by equipping them with the essential tools and skills demanded by today's developers. As part of this program, students like me are paired with local mentors who provide guidance through each module.

## Module Two Project

I am currently working on my second module, creating a RPG campaign manager application using React.js. By the end of this module I will be to:

1. Understands the 3-tier architecture, limitations and responsibilities of each tier.
2. Create fairly complex front-ends using React.js without help.
3. Be hireable as a junior front-end developer.

## FableForge

As an avid player of Dungeons and Dragons, I wanted to design a campaign manager that was easy to navigate and had the features I look for as a Dungeon Master or player. This project is a work in progress.
