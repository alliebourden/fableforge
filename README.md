# FableForge - Get Coding Module 2 Project

## Module Two Project

In 2023, I joined the Get Coding mentorship program. This program offers individuals an opportunity to reskill themselves for the dynamic tech industry by equipping them with the essential tools and skills demanded by today's developers. As part of this program, students like me are paired with local mentors who provide guidance through each module.

As of March 2024, I have completed my second Get Coding project, FableForge. This application was written in React.js.

## ⚔️ FableForge

FableForge is a toolkit designed for 5th edition Dungeon Masters. With FableForge, users can easily organize sessions, quests, and player loot. They can elevate the storytelling experience with AI tools for NPC creation, TTRPG maps, and entire campaign summaries.

The initial idea behind FableForge was to create an application for storing and sorting through individual session data. FableForge provides tools to log sessions, display them individually, and create a comprehensive campaign summary based on the gathered data. The Quest Tracker allows users to log both main and side quests, while the Loot Manager utilizes an API, enabling users to log their Dungeons and Dragons items and access associated descriptions.

## How to use

The Dashboard contains the NPC Generator, the Map Generator and the Dice Roller. [Watch this video for a walkthrough on how to use FableForge's OpenAI tools.](https://www.loom.com/share/be89f8b21b504073b01d3a6b3cd7172e?sid=0069a53a-6d09-4eff-87e7-3bd9f762c263)
